Very Simple to Use facebook library to get a list of a users friends 
and post to either their wall or a friends wall.

Setup the project just as facebook has described at 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/ios/build/. 
Except do not use their sdk source code. The source here has a copy that
prevents facebook from opening mobile safari. Get the app id and add 
it to the plist file as described at the site above.

in the FacebookEx.h file add the application id at

#define FBAppID @"<YOU_APP_ID>"

While the h file is open take note of the properties here. Each one is used
in your application to setup the parameters passed to the Facebook post dialog

In your application delegate add:

#import "FacebookEx.h"

...

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
    bool facebook = [defaults boolForKey:@"facebook_preference"];
    
    if (!facebook) {
        [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] logOutWithAlert:NO];
    }
}

This works with the Settings.Bundle file and allows the user to specify
whether or not to stay logged in from the iOS settings screen. It also is
used by the FacebookEx library to identify when to save the users settings

As an example this IBAction method is hooked to a button in interface builder.
It will launch the Facebook list into action.

- (IBAction)facebookAction:(id)sender{
    
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setMessage:@"message"];
    
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setName:@"Name"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setItunesURL:@"itunes"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setAndroidURL:@"android"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setPicture:@"https://www.google.com/intl/en_com/images/srpr/logo3w.png"];
    
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setProperties: [NSString stringWithFormat:
                                                 @"{\"Property One\":{\"Property Description\", \"href\":\"http://www.google.com\"},\"Property One\":{\"Property Description\", \"href\":\"http://www.google.com\"}}", 
                                                 [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] itunesURL], [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] androidURL] ]];
    
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setDescription:@"Description"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setCaption:@"Caption"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setLink:@"http://link"];
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] setRedirectURI: [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] itunesURL]];
    
    [[FacebookEx sharedInstance] displayFriendsListWithViewController:self];
}

Most of the above code sets properties that are used by the FacebookEX library as parameters for the dialog
boxes. Play with the settings to achieve the desired results. Note that the last line is what initiates and
opens Facebook.

Thats it. That is all you need to be running with Facebook.
